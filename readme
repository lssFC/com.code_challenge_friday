This coding challenge is created in JAVA Maven project
I have also added the extent reporting in it.

cases 1,2,3 are the given cases and also created one more additional case for other name combination
I have created two tests can be found in following location
test 1: test_address_simple_cases
test 2: test_address_complex_cases
test 3: test_address_complicated_cases
test 4: test_address_extra_cases

Steps:
1. Import current project from Git to eclipse
2. test data is located at : (ProjectRootDirectory)\errorLog\resource\

Test data is located at: (ProjectRootDirectory)\errorLog\resource\

To check the test reports:
After test run refresh the project and go to :  (ProjectRootDirectory)\test-output\testReport.html

For Test RUN:
1. Go to command prompt
2. go to root directory of the project
3. Type : mvn clean test  --> this will run all tests ( it also can be run via pom.xml --> located at project root level)
we can also run the cases via running the testng.xml file or from editor
